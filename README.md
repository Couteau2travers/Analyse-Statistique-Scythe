# Scythe Data Analysis – Python

## 🎯 Objective
TO analyse games of the board game Scythe, to answer : 
- Is the game balance ?
- What is the best strategie ?

This projet aim to show my competences with Python in **Data Analysis**.

## 📊 Données
- Source : dataset CSV (scrapped by myself, open Scrapping Links.py)
- Contents : 152 data colomun (exemples : number of player, player one faction, player one points...)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Scrapping links of games on BoardGameArena website (Scrapping Links.py)
2. Scrapping data of links (Scrapping Data.py)
3. Cleaning data
4. Creation of visuals
5. Analysis of the visuals

## 📈 Key Results
- Determination of the highest-performing faction
- Identification of the most effective faction–mat combination (detailed analysis available in the *Scythe* section)
- Evaluation of the optimal star acquisition strategy
